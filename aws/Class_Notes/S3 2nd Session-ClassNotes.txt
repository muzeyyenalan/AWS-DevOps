Examples of Lifecycle Configuration

* Lifecycle storage class transitions have the following constraints:

  - Object Size and Transitions from S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA to S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, or S3 One Zone-IA

  - When you transition objects from the S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA storage classes to S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, or S3 One Zone-IA, the following object size constraints apply:

  - Larger objects – For the following transitions, there is a cost benefit to transitioning larger objects:

    -- From the S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA storage classes to S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

    -- From the S3 Standard storage class to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA.

  - Objects smaller than 128 KB – For the following transitions, Amazon S3 does not transition objects that are smaller than 128 KB:

    -- From the S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA storage classes to S3 Intelligent-Tiering or S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.

    -- From the S3 Standard storage class to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA.

* Minimum Days for Transition from S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA

  - Before you transition objects from the S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA storage classes to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA, you must store them at least 30 days in the S3 Standard storage class. For example, you cannot create a Lifecycle rule to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class one day after you create them. Amazon S3 doesn't transition objects within the first 30 days because newer objects are often accessed more frequently or deleted sooner than is suitable for S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA storage.

  - Similarly, if you are transitioning noncurrent objects (in versioned buckets), you can transition only objects that are at least 30 days noncurrent to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA storage.

* Minimum 30-Day Storage Charge for S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA

  - The S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes have a minimum 30-day storage charge. Therefore, you can't specify a single Lifecycle rule for both an S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA transition and a S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive transition when the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive transition occurs less than 30 days after the S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA transition.

  - The same 30-day minimum applies when you specify a transition from S3 Standard-IA storage to S3 One Zone-IA. You can specify two rules to accomplish this, but you pay minimum storage charges. 

* Triggers for replication are:

  - Uploading objects to the source bucket.
  - DELETE of objects in the source bucket.
  - Changes to the object, its metadata, or ACL.

* What is replicated:

  - New objects created after enabling replication.
  - Changes to objects.
  - Objects created using SSE-S3 using the AWS managed key.
  - Object ACL updates.

* What isn’t replicated:

  - Objects that existed before enabling replication (can use the copy API).
  - Objects created with SSE-C and SSE-KMS.
  - Objects to which the bucket owner does not have permissions.
  - Updates to bucket-level subresources.
  - Actions from lifecycle rules are not replicated.
  - Objects in the source bucket that are replicated from another region are not replicated.

* Deletion behaviour:

  - If a DELETE request is made without specifying an object version ID a delete marker will be added and replicated.
  - If a DELETE request is made specifying an object version ID the object is deleted but the delete marker is not replicated.

* Charges:

  - Requests for upload.
  - Inter-region transfer.
  - S3 storage in both regions.
